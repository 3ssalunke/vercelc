// Controller provides base functionality and dependencies to routes.
// The proposed pattern is to embed a Controller in each individual route struct and to use
// the router to inject the container so your routes have access to the services within the container
type Controller struct {
	// Container stores a services container which contains dependencies
	Container *services.Container
}

// NewController creates a new Controller
func NewController(c *services.Container) Controller {
	return Controller{
		Container: c,
